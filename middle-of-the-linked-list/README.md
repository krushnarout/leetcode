## [876. Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

### Example 1:

![lc-midlist1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50e8acf6-f294-4e4f-826a-8c8bda75a956)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
```

### Example 2:

![lc-midlist2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/116734fb-0970-4795-a21c-853325143969)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
