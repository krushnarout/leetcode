## [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

### Example 1:

![rev1ex1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fc09cc6-810b-414d-913f-51511d011c92)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

### Example 2:

![rev1ex2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c397f64a-96a2-491a-a6a5-2d49c6d16526)

```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
