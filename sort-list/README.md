## [148. Sort List](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-list/)

Given the `head` of a linked list, return the list after sorting it in ascending order.

### Example 1:

![sort_list_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04bef8ed-f73c-489e-989c-db6557e3acfb)

```
Input: head = [4,2,1,3]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

### Example 2:

![sort_list_2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de00af23-deff-41ff-b8f4-b8b72b356b40)

```
Input: head = [-1,5,3,4,0]
Output: [-1,0,3,4,5]
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 5 * 104]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
 

**Follow up:** Can you sort the linked list in `O(n logn)` time and `O(1)` memory (i.e. constant space)?
